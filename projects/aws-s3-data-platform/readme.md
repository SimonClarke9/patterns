# Summary #
Use AWS Cloud to build a Data Platform. In this Data Platform we want to manage streaming data like Clicks
## Assumptions ##

# Data Ingestion #
Use AWS services like Kinesis Data Streams or AWS Glue to ingest data from sources like website clickstreams, purchase history, product catalogs, and user demographics.

## Collecting Data ##

## ETL Processes ##
### Cleaning ###
Ensure data is cleaned
### Transformation ###
transformed during ingestion to maintain consistency.

 


# Data Storage #
Store raw and processed data in Amazon S3 buckets, organized by data type and usage (e.g., raw data, processed data, analytics-ready data).

Use S3 lifecycle policies to manage storage costs by archiving older data to Amazon Glacier.

# Scalable Pipelines #
Implement ETL pipelines using AWS Glue or Apache Spark on Amazon EMR for processing large datasets.

Automate pipeline workflows with AWS Step Functions.

# Data Analytics #
Use Amazon Redshift or Athena for querying and analyzing data stored in S3.

Integrate with Amazon QuickSight for visualization and reporting.

# Machine Learning Integration #
Prepare data for machine learning models using Amazon SageMaker.

Train and deploy recommendation models that leverage user behavior and product data.

# Security and Governance #
Implement access controls using AWS IAM and encrypt data at rest and in transit.

Use AWS Lake Formation for managing data permissions and governance.

# Monitoring and Optimization #
Monitor pipelines and storage with Amazon CloudWatch.

Optimize costs using AWS Cost Explorer and S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
