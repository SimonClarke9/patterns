# Establishing a Clear and Maintainable Data Structure
-   Raw Layer: Backup streaming Store original, unaltered data as it is ingested. Use S3 store raw data for 30 day. Use lifecycle policy to migrates files after 30 days to Glacier Bucket , Enable S3 serverside data compression 
-   Processed Layer: Include clean and pre-processed data for ready-to-use ML tasks. Use S3 buckets per client /stream topic | category / region. Use date time partitioning.


# Ensuring Secure and Well-Governed Data Handling
Access Control: Implement fine-grained access controls using tools like  AWS IAM, role-based access.

Data Cataloging: Employ metadata management solutions to document datasets, track lineage, and ensure transparency.

Data Encryption: Utilize end-to-end encryption for both at-rest and in-transit data. Enable regular audits for compliance with standards like GDPR or CCPA. Use SÂ£ server side encryption.

# Optimized Storage and File Formats
File Formats:
-   Raw Data - JSON or csv files
-   Processed Parquet  with rle encoding.


Set up lifecycle policies for archiving or deleting unused data to reduce costs.

# Scalable Ingestion and Transformation Pipelines
Data Ingestion:

Use distributed data ingestion frameworks like Apache Kafka for real-time streaming data.

Batch ingestion can be implemented using tools like AWS Glue.

Transformation Pipelines:
-   AWS Lambda.

Modularize the transformation stages for easier maintenance and scalability.

# Putting It All Together
Orchestration: Use workflow orchestration tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect to manage dependencies, retries, and schedules across the ingestion, transformation, and training stages.

# Monitoring: 
Integrate monitoring and alerting systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, or Cloud-native equivalents) to ensure system health and efficiency.
